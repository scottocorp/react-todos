# react-todos
A simple todo app built with react and redux. The state is persisted to localStorage.

**NOTE:** Inspired by [this Backbone Todo app](http://backbonejs.org/docs/todos.html), but converted to ReactJS! The styling was borrowed 
from this app as well.

## Installation and Usage
```js
npm install
npm start
Then browse to http://localhost:8080/
```
